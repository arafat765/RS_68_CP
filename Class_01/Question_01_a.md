# Given Code Snippet

```java
int i, j, l = 0;
for (int i = n / 2; i <= n; i++)
{
    for (int j =2; j <= n; j++)
    {
        k = k + n / 2;
    }
}
```
Suppose we take n = 10;

---

## First Outer Loop:

It starts from n / 2 or 10 / 2 or 5.<br>
This means that any values before n / 2 are not considered.
<br>
<br>
Again, i <= n or i <= 10.<br>
This means that i will take values up to n and including n.
<br>
<br>
Thus we can formulate an expression as follows:
<br>
n - n / 2 + 1
<br>or, (2n - n) / 2 + 1
<br>or, n / 2 + 1
<br>
For higher values of n, we can simply ignore "+ 1" as it doesn't make much of a difference. The same can be said for 1 / 2.
<br>
Thus the time complexity of the outer loop is O(n).

---

## Second Inner Loop:

It starts from 2. And it goes until j <= n. Also, j increases by a multiple of 2 for each loop.
<br>
Thus, for n = 10, j = 2, 4, 8.
<br>Again, for n = 100 (suppose), j = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
<br>Thus we can formulate an expression as follows:
<br>
2<sup>k</sup> <= n.
<br>In a best-worst case, let us assume that 2<sup>k</sup> = n.
<br>or, k = log <sub>2</sub> n
<br><br>
Thus, the time complexity of the inner loop is O(log n).

---

## Operation inside the second loop:

The operation inside the loop has a time complexity of O(1) or constant time.

---

# Analyzing total time complexity:

Thus, we have O(n) * O(log n) * O(1).
<br>O(1) doesn't have any effect in determing the time complexity and thus, it can be removed.
<br>Therefore, we have the total time complexity of O(n log n) for the given code snippet.
